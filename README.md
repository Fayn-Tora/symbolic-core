# symbolic-core

Core symbolic engine for activating intelligent models across organizations, environments, and user signals.  
From whisper to execution.

## Overview

`symbolic-core` is a foundational runtime designed to enable symbolic activation of intelligent models. It allows organizations to expose their tools, services, and logic as executable units that respond to contextual signals and operational needs.

## Key Concepts

- Symbolic activation of models and tools
- Cross-organizational integration
- Interpretation of user signals into executable flows
- Environment-aware execution logic

## Modules

- `signal-parser`: Parses symbolic input from users or systems
- `model-router`: Routes requests to the appropriate symbolic model
- `executor`: Executes logic across local, cloud, or edge environments
- `feedback-loop`: Captures output and feeds it back into the system

## Use Cases

- Remote activation of devices such as 3D printers
- Intelligent assistants for product selection and service guidance
- Code deployment to hardware units like Arduino
- Symbolic workflows across distributed organizations

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fayn-Tora/symbolic-core.git
cd symbolic-core
npm install
# or
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Philosophy

`symbolic-core` is not just a framework. It represents a symbolic thinking layer that encodes operational logic, user intent, and institutional intelligence into a unified executable form.
